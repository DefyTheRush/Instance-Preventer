# Instance Preventer


A program that creates a new Program.cs file for your C# project, which prevents more than one program running at a time

Features:
- Simple & Lightweight Design
- Folder Choosing and Names for the text boxes
- Creates a Program_new.cs file for you to look at and determine what needs to be added
	- Prevents data loss with over-writing the existing Program.cs
- Credits and Info
- Doesn't replace existing Program.cs (makes a new one) until you choose to replace it
- Inception: You cannot even run this program more than once!

Tips + Images
- Use the Name, Text, and Namespace parts of your code to make this right
- Snipping Tool messed up the underlining on these images..

Usage:
- Load the program up, find the folder you want to place your new .cs file in, add in the Namespace, App, and Form data then create the file!

Notes:
- I may clean the code and arrays later but I'm happy with the result so far
